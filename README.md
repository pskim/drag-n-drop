Drag and Drop
Uses Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS 

Open index.html page and it is ready to go.

Dragging an element previous to the drop location looks like it is not dropping in the correct place.
This is actually correct behavior as the elements relocate themselves to keep order.
Ex. item 1 gets changed with item 3. It looks like item 1 and switched locations instead of 3. What is
also happening is the first position is gone and reshifts everything having item 2 and then 1 and then 3.m
